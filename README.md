"𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮"---->𝐖𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐞, 𝐑𝐮𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐲𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 Java language is similar to C Plus Plus; But it has a simpler object-oriented model and supports fewer low-level capabilities. The idea of ​​Java's objectivity is taken from the Smalltalk language. One of the fundamental features of Java is that it manages memory automatically. The performance reliability of programs written in this language is higher than the first generation C languages. Java programs are byte-coded and converted to machine code by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). If there is a JVM like other languages ​​based on it that are not dependent on a specific operating system, programs written in Java can be executed on any type of operating system and any electronic device. The slogan of Java is "Write once, Run anywhere" (Write once, Run anywhere), which refers to this feature. This Java feature is called platform independent.  Java Virtual Machine (J𝗩𝗠) is a program that compiles Java language bytecodes according to a specific operating system and prepares them for execution at the operating system level. In fact, the main motto of Java language (write once and run anywhere) is implemented using this virtual machine. It has become possible.  ▂ ▄ ▅ ▆ ▇ █ goals █ ▇ ▆ ▅ ▄ ▂  There were five main goals in creating the Java language: This language should be simple, object oriented and popular. Be sure and error-free. It is not dependent on computer architecture and can be transferred. It must run with high efficiency. It should be dynamically threaded.
